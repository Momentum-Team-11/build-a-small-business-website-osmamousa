    <img src="starter_files/images/wild-hyacinth.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. <br>It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. <br>Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after<br> the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.

    </h4>
    <img src="starter_files/images/lily-of-the-valley.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle above bright emerald-green leaves --<br> this nearly deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the pretty plant<br> is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will<br> want to watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well. Warning: this plant is poisonous.

        These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and Uruguay and form dense clumps of perennial<br> flowers to chase the winter doldrums away. These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs. They can get up to <br>half a foot tall with a similar spread. Each bulb will produce numerous flowering stems with slender,<br> deeply green foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.
